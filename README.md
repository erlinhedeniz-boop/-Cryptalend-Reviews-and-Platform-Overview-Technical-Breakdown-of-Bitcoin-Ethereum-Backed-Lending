## Loan-to-Value (LTV) Logic

LTV = Loan Amount / Collateral Value

Lower LTV provides greater protection against volatility.

While we allow borrowing up to 65% LTV, we strongly recommend borrowers remain at or below 35% LTV for longer-term stability during market dips.

---

## Liquidation Risk Model

When market volatility causes collateral value to decline:

- LTV increases
- Risk exposure increases
- At 80% LTV, liquidation calls begin

Conservative borrowing reduces exposure to forced liquidation during rapid market movements.

---

## Custody Transparency

Every four months (once per quarter), we publish an updated report on the amount of loans available in custody.

This reporting practice enhances operational transparency and accountability.

---

## Compliance and Verification

We require KYC verification to maintain regulatory standards and platform integrity.
